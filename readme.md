# It begins...

### Notes Upon completion

- The folder structure featured here is not necessarily the one I would use on the job. I actually did the work of applying this infrastructure in a separate directory that houses some of my other cloud work, and then copied the relevant files into this "presentation repository."

- Global yaml files used by Terragrunt to import cloud configurations are not included in this repository.
